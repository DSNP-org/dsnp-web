<h2>DSNP</h2>
<p>
<b>The Decentralized Social Networking Protocol establishes a shared social layer that is no longer dependent on a specific application or a centralized platform.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  Like SMTP for email or HTTP for the web, DSNP is application-agnostic, allowing for an open marketplace and ecosystem of interoperable apps and services. DSNP serves as the linkage between the consensus layer (such as a public blockchain) and the application layer (social apps and websites), defining common operations and data structures. The consensus layer secures and stores important user information such as the relationships that form each user's social graph, and users control delegation and revocation of access to their data on a per-application basis. Since applications do not control user data, a user may freely choose another DSNP application without losing access to their social identity or social graph.
