**Project Liberty Institute (PLI)** is hosting an [initial convening](https://www.rightscon.org/exp-program/) at **RightsCon 2025** to discuss the collaborative governance of the **Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP)**.

As decentralized communication platforms grow, so do the governance challenges they face. How can users, developers, and community members ensure these platforms remain responsive to their needs? This gathering will provide a unique opportunity to **share experiences, explore governance models, and build cross-cutting policy networks**.

#### Event Highlights:

* **Participant-Driven Discussions:** Moderated by decentralized technology leaders **Wendy Seltzer** and **Audrey Tang**, these interactive sessions will focus on gaining insights from participants on governance challenges and best practices.
* **Blockchain Governance Toolkit Deployment:** Discover cutting-edge tools designed to facilitate transparent and decentralized decision-making processes.
* **Interactive Peer Exchange Sessions:** A series of dynamic discussions and collaborative workshops featuring top practitioners, policymakers, and innovators in the field.

With **over 1.5 million users worldwide**, DSNP is on its path toward **progressive** **decentralization** with the goal of empowering individuals with a voice, choice, and stake in their digital lives. This convening will serve as a key milestone in this journey, gathering feedback on the many governance documents published throughout 2024. Most importantly, this event will serve as a launchpad for ongoing collaborations, with further convenings planned across different regions in 2025.
