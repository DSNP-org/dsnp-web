In these last months the DSNP governance working group collected valuable feedback from experts and our community on the first draft governance framework. 

This feedback sparked discussions which led us to update our action plan for the upcoming phases in our  journey toward decentralization. 


#### Phase 1: Mapping & Definitions

Our first focus is on establishing a shared understanding of key concepts that guide our thinking and actions, such as governance, community, ecosystem, and decentralization, in the context of DSNP. We recognize that every discipline has a unique set of terms with specific interpretations, so here is [how we are using these terms](https://dsnp.org/governance/glossary.html) for DSNP governance.

We will conduct a community & governance comparative analysis in collaboration with the Comparative Analysis Working Group (CA-WG), drawing insights from similar governance systems to clarify our approach. This includes mapping relevant resources and protocol comparisons to integrate best practices and support the design of our decision-making process.

This phase will also define the scope of our protocol governance and explore its relationship with other layers of governance. This scope will be useful for various stakeholders to engage with their preferred layer of governance depending on their areas of concern. 


#### Phase 2: Minimum Viable Decentralization

In November of 2024, the [Project Liberty Summit](https://summit.projectliberty.io/) will take place, where participants will have direct access to the DSNP governance work, making this an opportunity to gather additional feedback. 

This phase will most importantly include compiling a Playbook for Progressive Decentralization, which will serve as a practical guide for our roadmap towards more decentralization. This playbook will eventually help us refine our Draft Governance Framework. 

Additionally, we will develop metrics to evaluate our progress, ensuring that we stay aligned with our goals and are later held accountable based on our mission and principles. 

Together, these phases will lay a solid foundation for our commitment to effective and inclusive decentralization. 

As always, please feel free to reach out with questions, comments, thoughts by email to [dsnpfeedback@projectliberty.io](mailto:dsnpfeedback@projectliberty.io) or on the [DSNP Forum](https://forums.projectliberty.io/c/dsnp-governance/13).
