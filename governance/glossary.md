## Governance Glossary of Key Terms
We recognize that every discipline has a unique set of terms with specific interpretations. Here is a brief glossary of how we’re using terms in the context of DSNP: 

#### Governance 

...refers to the decision-making processes and structures that guide development, maintenance, and evolution. With respect to DSNP, governance specifies mechanisms for proposing changes, reaching consensus, and implementing updates across the various layers of the DSNP ecosystem. Governance should adhere to our [principles](./mission-principles.md) of decentralization and community involvement.

In a complex system, choices at one level affect those elsewhere. We promote subsidiarity, and governance at the lowest effective level, while remaining responsive to higher-level needs. Thus governance of the protocol should be responsive to the needs of the ecosystem, and governance of the ecosystem will be effected, in part, through technical architecture. 

#### Community
_(synonyms: electorate, citizenry)_

...refers to the active group of individuals and organizations involved with the protocol. This includes developers, contributors, early adopters, and engaged users who collaborate, share knowledge, and work towards the common goal of advancing DSNP. The community is characterized by shared values, mutual support, and a collective identity centered around decentralized social networking.

It also encompasses the broader base of everyday users who utilize DSNP-based applications and services, forming the foundation of the network's social fabric.

#### Ecosystem 

...refers to the comprehensive network of interconnected elements surrounding the protocol. The DSNP ecosystem includes the core technology, applications built on DSNP, related protocols and services, developers, users, and stakeholders. It encompasses both the technical infrastructure and the broader environment in which DSNP operates and evolves, including its economic, social, and technological aspects.

#### Decentralization 

...refers to the distribution of power and decision-making across multiple participants. There can be different degrees of decentralized control, rather than a system being purely centralized or fully decentralized. Decentralization can be understood as a spectrum and is not an end goal itself, as the optimal degree of decentralization depends on the system’s goals, needs, and context. DSNP governance aims for progressive decentralization along this spectrum balancing various trade-offs such as participation, efficiency, security, and community control.
