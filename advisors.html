          <h2>Advisory Council</h2>
          <p>
          DSNP is managed by <a href="https://projectliberty.io">Project Liberty</a> and advised by a group of
          experts with long and deep history in Internet protocol and
          governance development. This team of expert advisors has
          done foundational work across protocol development, data
          privacy, and in developing the technology governance models
          the Internet relies on today. They bring deep experience in
          technological innovation and community-building, and are
          committed to bringing DSNP to the next stage, both
          technically and in how it is developed and managed in the
          future.
